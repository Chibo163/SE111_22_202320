        <p style="border:1px solid violet">My name is <i>Josh</i>, I enjoy playing <u>Dungeons and Dragons</u>, <u>writing</u>, and <u>designing games</u>. I currently work at <i>Market Basket Warwick</i> as an assistant manager- a recent promotion so learning all of the ins-and-outs has been a challenge. For a large portion of my life I've trained in many forms of <i>martial arts</i>; while I don't have a lot of time to train nowadays, it was still essential to helping me progress and grow to where I am today. For all of middle and high school I was homeschooled, so being at NEIT is a totally different experience and something I'm not used to just yet. Personally I'm enjoying being back in public school and look forward to the next terms!</p>
