                <p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is a surprisingly good adaptation of Critial Role's first campaign. While certain details were modified/changed for the reason of fitting a different medium, the show is very true to the source material. This is usually considered a good thing, but considering how NSFW Critial Role can get at times... I was less than enthused. The first season was pretty rough in this regard, but the second season has been a lot more enjoyable for me- I think this is because I wasn't constantly cringing waiting for the next NSFW joke.</p>

                <p>The story is extremely fun to follow and it's easy to get invested in the characters and world of Exandria. The main cast weave their character's stories together masterfully, making the show very fun to watch. As a big fan of high fantasy, I can safely recommend <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> to anyone 16+ who is interested in/played D&D before. I really like this show and hope that the next couple of seasons leading up to the finale are as good (if not better) than the first two.</p>
