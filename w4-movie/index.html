                <!--main content here--><p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is an animated series that focuses on the journey of seven unlikely heroes as they rise to the status of legendary heroes. The show is based off of a <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> campaign played by a group known as <i>Critical Role</i>; this game lasted for almost three years and boosted the popularity of the show to a point where almost everyone in the Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) community had at least heard about <i>Critical Role</i>. Overtime the group's popularity only grew, they played multiple years-long campaigns and eventually reached a point where they were able to crowd-fund a tv show recapping their very first campaign- where everything started.</p>

                <p>The show features a main cast of Scanlan Shorthalt (played by Sam Riegel), Grog Strongjaw (played by Travis Willingham, Pike Trickfoot (played by Ashley Johnson), Vax'ildan (played by Liam O'brien), Vex'ahlia (played by Laura Bailey), Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (played by Taliesen Jaffe) and the Dungeon Master of the game Matthew Mercer plays a multitude of characters in the show.</p>
